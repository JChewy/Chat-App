# MitnickVersusNSA


This is a tribute to the legendary hacker Kevin Mitnick built on Node.js and Socket.io 

This is a two-player game with two sides 

1) The Hacker (Kevin Mitnick)
2) The NSA

(I know historically that Mitnick was on the run from the FBI, but MitnickVersusNSA just sounded edgier) 

To play with your friends, simply pick the same server name!
